# Simple script to notify when our battery is low.  Notifies once a day,
# resetting at midnight.  Run this every hour.  If it does not run at
# midnight, make sure to update the code that resets NOTIFIED so that
# you'll be reminded once a day if the battery is still low.

# Requirements
#  Using Unifying Receiver
#  solaar - For reading battery levels

# Optional Requirements
#  mail - For sending mail on the local machine to notify on low battery
#  curl - For using a URL for notification of low battery

# TODO
#  Historical log
#   Keep 'history' out of the vars file and instead log separately
#   Could potentially write something to estimate battery life based on data in log
#  Re-notify after N days/hours

# You must create this file with your personal settings in it, an example file
# is provided.  Make sure the name is as below, or update the file path below.
